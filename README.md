## Development Documentation for ShifterMan:

### How to get the code?

### For the better understanding of the source code:

### Project License
Our project license will be GNU GPL-General Public License, The GPL is the first copyleft license for general use, which means that derived works can only be distributed under the same license terms.

This is in distinction to permissive free software licenses, of which the BSD licenses are the standard examples.
