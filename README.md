## Development Documentation for ShifterMan:

### How to get the code?

The source code is available in our ShifterMan Source Code directory in this repository: 
[https://github.com/kakifish/ShifterMan/tree/master/ShifterMans%20Source%20Code/ShifterMans%20Source%20Code] (https://github.com/kakifish/ShifterMan/tree/master/ShifterMans%20Source%20Code/ShifterMans%20Source%20Code).

### For the better understanding of the source code:

The code will be documented with comment in each and every source code file.
Also we will make big effort to write comments for the methods we write.

### Project License

This is in distinction to permissive free software licenses, of which the BSD licenses are the standard examples.

### How to compile the project?

Our project is built with C# language on asp.net framework, therefore you can download the code and compile it with the regular Microsoft Visual StudioÂ© software compiler.

steps:

1) Download visual studio 2012.

2) Take this short tutorial to install git and open new team project in your visual studio that will be connected to our repository.

3) Start working on the project!!

* Note: if you use earlier version of visual studio you can just:

1) Using Git for windows open a repository on your computer.

2) Open new web site project using file system, choose as your file system the source code directory that is in your copy directory of the repository.

3) Start programing and don't forget to commit your changes.

### How to prepare a new version?

The new version is supposed to solve all the bugs that were found on the earlier releases.
You can find in the [Bug Report Page] (https://github.com/kakifish/ShifterMan/wiki/User-Bug-Report) all the bugs that were found in the previos version and wich bugs are resolved.
According to the bug report you can create a new and better version of the program and tell us about your progress in the bug report page.
If you have some new feature to add, you can create it and send us an email about this new feature and we will deside if we want to save or descard the idia.
We wont save earlier versions in the repository but we will have a those versions saved on directories on the team members computers. Those directories will be numbered by versions.
If you wouled like to get a copy of an earlier vertion files, you can write an email to one of our team members.
