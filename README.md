## Development Documentation for ShifterMan:

### How to get the code?
The source code is available in our ShifterMan Source Code directory in this repository: 
[https://github.com/kakifish/ShifterMan/tree/master/ShifterMans%20Source%20Code/ShifterMans%20Source%20Code] (https://github.com/kakifish/ShifterMan/tree/master/ShifterMans%20Source%20Code/ShifterMans%20Source%20Code).

### For the better understanding of the source code:
The code will be documented with comment in each and every source code file.
Also we will make big effort to write comments for the methods we write.

### Project License
Our project license will be GNU GPL-General Public License, The GPL is the first copyleft license for general use, which means that derived works can only be distributed under the same license terms.
Under this philosophy, the GPL grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the free software definition and uses copyleft to ensure the freedoms are preserved, even when the work is changed or added to.
This is in distinction to permissive free software licenses, of which the BSD licenses are the standard examples.

### Information about a directory structure and files?
In the [Source Code Directory] (https://github.com/kakifish/ShifterMan/tree/master/ShifterMans%20Source%20Code/ShifterMans%20Source%20Code/ShifterMan) you will find the directories and files:
Files:
Web.config: this file includes the connection string of the Database and more crucial informaation in order to the web site to work. Do not make changes in this file.



### Project design:
We will divide folders building into three layers:

1) The _ShifterMans GUI_ (details will be Available soon).  

2) The _ShifterMans Logic_ (details will be Available soon).

3) The _ShifterMans DataBase_ (details will be Available soon).
